# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This repo is for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course project, part of the Data Science Specialization from Johns Hopkins University.

The purpose of the project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.
The final goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

**Files included in this repository:**
1) run_analysis.R: R script that performs the entire analysis routine
2) TidySet.txt: Output tidy data set resulting from the run_analysis.R script 
3) CodeBook.md: Code book describing the data, variables, and transformations performed to the data
4) README.md: Project description and contents (this file)

**R Script Requirements:**

The run_analysis.R script must do the following:
1) Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3) Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
5) Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
